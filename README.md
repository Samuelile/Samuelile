I live within the midwestern region of the United States. Since the spring of 2019 I have been facinated by the world of cryptocureency and blockchain technology. I have taken this excitement and applied it to contract and blockchain development. I enjoy progamminging in python and solidilty.

Within this portfolio I have included a number of projects and contracts I have compiled.

Skills: PYTHON / SOLIDITY / TRUFFLE / HARDHAT
